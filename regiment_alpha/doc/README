[2005/2006]
This directory is used to build the Regiment Documentation.

There are a few complications.

 1) The complex schemedoc tree cannot currently be added to the svn
repository without corrupting it.  (Maybe it will work with future
versions of subversion.)  This is mysterious, but to get around it I
have included schemedoc only as a tarball, which is unpacked by the
makefile.  (Note, it may be necessariy to include "patches" to the
tarball to avoid too many modifications to it in the repository.)

 2) Schemedoc doesn't handle well all the sequences of characters you
find in the Regiment source.  I've also found a number of bugs in
Schemedoc in the process of applying it to Regiment's relatively large
codebase.  So I currently have to "scrub_source" before giving it to
schemedoc.  You can look in scrub_source.ss to see what things I'm
currently filtering out.


[2006.02.10]
  As of now some but not all Regiment files are Schemedoc'd.  You can
look in the Makefile to see which ones.
