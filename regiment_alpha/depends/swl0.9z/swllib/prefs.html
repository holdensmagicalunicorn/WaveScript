<h1>Preferences</h1>

The editor, repl, and interaction window each have a <i>Preferences</i>
menu that allows the user to configure certain options, such as
the font used to display text.
Preferences for the editor, repl, or interaction window
may be saved across sessions by selecting the <i>Save preferences</i>
option from the <i>Preferences</i> menu.
Preferences must be saved explicitly for each type of window.
For example, saving repl preferences saves only the repl preferences,
but does not save any changes to editor preferences
since the last time editor preferences were saved.
<p>
<h3>Local preferences and the <tt>.swlprefs</tt> file.</h3>
At startup, SWL searches for a preferences file named <tt>.swlprefs</tt>
in the current working directory.
If no <tt>.swlprefs</tt> file is found in the current directory,
SWL searches in a machine-dependent location.
On a Windows machine, SWL uses the value of the registry key
<tt>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Chez Scheme\swl<i>version</i>\SwlPrefsDir</tt>,
where <i>version</i> is the the SWL version number (bound to <tt>swl:version</tt> at startup).
This registry key is normally set when SWL is installed.
On Unix machines, including Mac OS X, SWL looks for the <tt>.swlprefs</tt>
file in the directory specified by the <tt>SWL_PREFS_DIR</tt> environment
variable, if set, or in the user's <tt>HOME</tt> directory.
<p>
To maintain separate SWL profiles, create a new working directory, create
an empty <tt>.swlprefs</tt> file in that directory, and start SWL from
that directory.
Since SWL finds a <tt>.swlprefs</tt> file in the current directory,
it will not examine your global <tt>.swlprefs</tt> file, e.g., in your
home directory, and changes to preferences will be saved in the local
<tt>.swlprefs</tt> file.
<p>
The <tt>.swlprefs</tt> file is formatted as a Scheme association list,
that is, a list of pairs where the car of each pair is a key that be
used to retrieve the associated value, which stored in the cdr of that pair.
The repl saves its preferences under the key <tt>repl</tt>, the editor
under <tt>editor</tt>, and the interaction window under <tt>interaction-window</tt>.
In each case, the value is an association.
Since these applications can be configured using a <i>Preferences</i> menu,
it is better not to edit the <tt>.swlprefs</tt> file by hand.
<h3>System preferences</h3>
While the editor, repl, and interaction window maintain application-specific
preferences of their own, a few other preferences exist that affect the behavior
of SWL system-wide.
System-wide options are also stored in the association list contained in
the <tt>.swlprefs</tt> file.  The following table describes the keys and
the expected values.
<ul>
<li><tt>external-applications</tt>
<p>
<td>An association list containing one or more of the following keys:
 <ul>
 <li><tt>open-url-command</tt><p>
     A string containing a command line to be used to open a given URL.
     When the user attempts to open a web page from within SWL, a
     <tt>system</tt> command line is built by supplying this string and
     the URL string as argument to <tt>format</tt>.  For example, to
     open the URL in the text-mode <tt>lynx</tt> browser under Unix, 
     include the following in the <tt>external-applications</tt>
     association list: <pre>(open-url-command "xterm -e lynx ~a")</pre></li>
<li><tt>web-browser</tt><p>
    A symbol or string naming a command to use to open a given URL.
    When the user attempts to open a web page from within SWL, a <tt>system</tt>
    command line is built by placing the URL after the <tt>web-browser</tt> command.
    For example, to open URLs using the Konqueror web browser under KDE, 
    include the following in the <tt>external-applications</tt> association list:
    <pre>(web-browser "kfmclient openURL")</pre>
    If both <tt>web-browser</tt> and <tt>open-url-command</tt> are specified,
    the <tt>open-url-command</tt> takes precedence.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li><tt>swl-global</tt><p>
An association list containing one or more of the following keys:
<ul>
 <li><tt>splash-screen</tt><p>
     A boolean indicating whether or not to display the SWL splash screen on startup.
     To disable the splash screen, include the following in the <tt>swl-global</tt>
     association list: <pre>(splash-screen . #f)</pre></li>
<!--
<li><tt>start-dir</tt><p>
     A string containing the path of the working directory that SWL should
     <tt>cd</tt> to at startup. For example, to start in the "Documents"
     subdirectory of your home directory, include the following in the
     <tt>swl-global</tt> association list:<pre>(start-dir . "~/Documents")</pre></li>
-->
<li><tt>on-startup</tt><p>
    An expression to run at startup.  The expression is evaluated in an environment
    that binds <tt>args</tt> to a list of the command-line arguments supplied when
    SWL was invoked.  For readability, this key-value pair is
    a two-element list rather than a single pair.
    The default setting is equivalent to the following:
<pre>
(on-startup
  (if (and (not (null? args)) (string=? (car args) "--edit"))
      (if (null? (cdr args))
          (new-edit)
          (for-each new-edit (cdr args)))
      (begin
        (for-each load args)
        (new-repl 'default))))
</pre>
</li>
</li>
</ul>

Take care when editing the <tt>.swlprefs</tt> file by hand
Changes may be lost if you have SWL save preferences to a file
that you have edited.
A malformed <tt>.swlprefs</tt> file can cause errors when SWL is started.
