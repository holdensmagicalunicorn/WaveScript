I'm writing down most of my *thinking* in AMORIDEAS.emacs.txt.  But I
realized that my day-to-day development issues should go in a separate
file; so here we are. -2004.04.29

  Hmm, without "identifier-syntax" I can't get things working fully
under PLT.  Until I can write a "lazy-letrec" macro for PLT I'm not
going to be able to have testing in drscheme.  Sigh.  Ok, for the
moment I'm just going to focus on the chez code.

WEIRD. Chez scheme started up with the normal heap is hanging on
(define-record a (b c)).  What is wrong with my system right now??

[2004.05.26]
  Right now I'm trying to hack the final Sim_nought together.
Annoying model/view issues without object system.  It's gonna be work
to get the plt version working.

  15:30: There! Dammit, the basic simulator works in swl.  Now gotta
get an actual meaningful display of it up.
  17:30: Yay! Ok, for the first time runnning a little token-machine
with graphics!

[2004.06.09] {How to return values?}
 9:47am:   Ok, I'm trying to tie together the compiler and the
graphical simulator.  Right now I'm trying to figure out how
*returning values* should work.  Especially since almost all the
return values will be streams.

 8:05pm:  I'm all screwed up now wrt the status of local bindings for
token handlers.  I'm trying to make my token-language a little wider
than it needs to be for my compiler, that makes it easier for me to
make test-cases by hand. 

[2004.06.10]
  Need to think about what happens when two processes are using
gradients when the same token name, and they start hitting eachother!
Sonuds like a big problem, how did that not occur to me before.
