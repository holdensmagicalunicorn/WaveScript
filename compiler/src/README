I need to explain the multi-backend structure of this project.  For
now suffice it to say that it supports two backends (drscheme and
chezscheme).  There's a directory for shared code (generic) and
directories specific to each.  Sometimes within the shared code I
might use the "current_interpreter" variable to switch the behavior
based on which backend we're using.
