I'm starting this file as a seperate place from AMORIDEAS to think
about the cost model that I've *got to have*.

Thinking about metrics used in that Bill Theis "Linear Analysis" paper...

Wait, wait, first a bit of meta-reasoning, the cost model must be
either: 
  *) Context free, parts of the program are assigned a cost w/out
     regard to their context
  *) Context sensitive - a much trickier computation, probably using
     existing program analysis techniques.

Well let's first think about reasoning over all connection topologies.
