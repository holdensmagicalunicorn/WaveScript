			Bryan's Object System

BOS is a very simple object system for Scheme, based on generic
functions and multiple inheritance.  Its interface looks similar to
those provided by (Tiny) CLOS, EuLisp, and Meroon.  Why didn't I use
any of those rather than roll my own object system?  I didn't want to
be weighed down with a meta-object protocol that I'd be unlikely to
use.  The implementation isn't particularly optimised, as it was put
together more as a proof of concept than anything else, but it should
still be significantly faster than MOP-based systems.

BOS was originally intended to run under Scheme 48, but has been
tested with SCM and should probably work with any R4RS Scheme that
provides an ERROR function.  If your Scheme system supports R4RS
syntactic macros (or you use SLIB, which provides them), all the
better.

See the `box.texi' file for TeXinfo documentation of the interfaces
provided by BOS.  Your mileage may vary while using this code.  If you
encounter any problems, drop me a note and I'll see what I can do to
help.
