<h1>Editor Help</h1>

Use the editor to create files containing your programs.
The editor has several features that simplify editing of Scheme programs,
including automatic parenthesis highlighting, automatic indentation,
movement by S-expression, and integration with the REPL.
<p>
Just below the menu of the editor is a one-line text area
where the editor normally displays the line and character position
of the cursor.
This area is also used when searching for text within the file
and when displaying the source of syntax errors.

<h3>Common Key Bindings</h3>
The REPL and the Editor share a set of
<a href="keys.html">common key bindings</a>
for cursor movement and editing.  These bindings are described on
a separate page.
<p>

<h3>Key Bindings Specific to the Editor</h3>
<table><tr><th>Key</th><th>Action</th></tr>
<tr><td nowrap>Alt+a</td><td>Save file as...</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap>Alt+s</td><td>Save file</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap>Alt+g</td><td>Save the file and load it into the REPL</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap>Alt+&lt;</td><td>Move to beginning of buffer</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap>Alt+&gt;</td><td>Move to end of buffer</td></tr>
</table>
