<h1>About SWL</h1>

Scheme Widget Library (SWL)<br>
Copyright (c) 1998 Oscar Waddell

<p>
Written by (in alphabetical order): Carl Bruggeman, Robert G. Burger,
R. Kent Dybvig, Erik Hilsdale, Oscar Waddell, John Zuckerman, with
contributions from Walter Kovaleski of Abstrax, Inc.

<p>
SWL development has been supported by the National Science Foundation
(under grant number CDA-9312614), Indiana University, and Cadence
Research Systems.

<p>
SWL is based on Scriptics' Tcl/Tk system and runs in Chez Scheme and/or
Petite Chez Scheme.

<p>
SWL is distributed under the same terms as the Tcl/Tk system upon which
it is based, as described under <a href="#license">license</a> below.

<p>
SWL is very much a work in progress, and is still in prerelease form.
A few of its major deficiencies are listed below:

<ul>
 <li>The current thread schedular levies a large penalty on run-time
     performance (often in excess of <em>10%</em>).  This affects
     timings as well as performance.

 <li>The global namespace is poluted by many hundreds of names that don't
     belong there, and redefining or assigning these names can cause
     SWL to malfunction.

 <li>The HTML viewer is very incomplete and cannot even handle our own
     documentation properly.  You're better off using Netscape to view
     the documentation.

 <li>Many more aspects of SWL's appearance and behavior should be
     controlled by preferences, and it should be possible to save
     preferences from one use of SWL to the next.

 <li>Many of the tools, including the stepper, graphical inspector,
     and profile viewer are out of date and are not included in the
     binary distribution.
</ul>

<p>
SWL Source is available from
http://www.cs.indiana.edu/proglang/swl.
Feel free to grab it and (a) fix any bugs you find, (b) add any new features
you like, (c) port it to the most recent version of Tcl/Tk if not already
done, (d) port it to new the most recent version of Chez Scheme if not
already done, or (e) port it to another Scheme system.
Please let us know about any such changes
at swl@cs.indiana.edu.

<p>
If you find a bug, please take a few minutes to isolate it and create
a short file or sequence of expressions that exposes the bug.
If you feel like fixing it yourself, please do!  Send us the code that
exposes the bug along with the required fix, and we'll put it into
the next release.
If you don't feel like fixing it yourself, send us the (short) code that
exposes the bug and we'll try to track it down.
In either case, please send us a transcript and/or complete description
of the errant behavior.
If we can't reproduce a problem, we can't fix it.
Send all information about SWL bugs to swl@cs.indiana.edu.
