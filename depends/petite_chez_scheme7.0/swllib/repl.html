<h1>REPL Help</h1>

Use the read-eval-print-loop, or REPL, to evaluate Scheme expressions
interactively.  The system displays a prompt, typically "&gt;", and awaits
your input.  Type a Scheme expression and submit it to the evaluator by
pressing the Enter key.
The REPL computes and prints the value of the expression, then waits for
another expression.  By default, expressions are colored blue once submitted
to the evaluator; results are printed in black.
<p>
<h3>Common Key Bindings</h3>
The REPL and the Editor share a set of
<a href="keys.html">common key bindings</a>
for cursor movement and editing.  These bindings are described on
a separate page.
<p>

<h3>History</h3>
The REPL keeps a temporary history of the expressions you enter.
Using the keys listed below you can navigate through
the history to recall expressions in order to edit or re-evaluate them.
To avoid confusion, history movement is disabled when you begin typing
an expression and is enabled again when the new prompt is displayed.
The expression history is discarded when you close the REPL, but you
can save the current history to a file or load a
previously saved history via the File--&gt;History menu.
<p>
<table><tr><th align=left>Keys</th>
           <th align=left>Action</th></tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr> <td>Up</td><td>Previous history item</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Ctrl+p</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Esc p</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td> </tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr> <td>Down</td><td>Next history item</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Ctrl+n</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Esc n</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td> </tr>
</table>

<h3>History search</h3>
To search through the history, type the first few characters of the
desired expression and press Esc and then p, to search through previous
history items, or Esc followed by n, to search through following history
items.
When a match is found, pressing Esc p or Esc n again continues the search.
<p>
Esc p and Esc n search for expressions that start with the text you enter.
To find matches that contain the search text anywhere, not just at the start
of the expression, use Esc P and Esc N instead.
<p>
When you find the desired expression, you can edit it as usual.
Any edit terminates the history search.
If the cursor is at the end of the expression, pressing the Enter
key submits the expression for evaluation.
If the cursor is not at the end of the expression,
pressing the Enter key opens a new line.
To enter an expression immediately, without moving to the end of the
expression, press Ctrl+Enter.
<p>

<h3>Controlling evaluation</h3>

If the REPL is taking too long to evaluate some expression,
you can interrupt the computation by typing Ctrl+c
(hold down Control and then press c) or by using the
Control--&gt;Interrupt menu item.
When the computation is interrupted, you will typically be given
a "debug&gt;" prompt.
Enter "q" to exit the debugger and discard the computation,
"i" to inspect the continuation, or "e" to exit the debugger and
resume the computation.
Enter "?" for help at the "debug&gt;" prompt for a list of other options.
<p>

<h3>Controlling the environment</h3>

Before testing your programs it is often helpful to first clean the
environment.  Cleaning the environment discards any definitions you may
have entered in the REPL or loaded from files, leaving the system in a
pristine state as if SWL had just been started afresh.
This lets you verify that your file contains all the definitions
needed by your program.  If your program works before cleaning the
environment, but fails afterward with
error messages complaining of unbound variables, there is a good
chance that a definition missing from the file was entered in the
REPL rather than the Editor.  The missing definition can probably
be found by navigating the REPL's expression history.
<p>
To clean the environment select "Clean environment..." from the REPL's
Control menu.
This will enter and evaluate the expression <tt>(clean-environment)</tt>
in the REPL, where it can be recalled more quickly from the keyboard
using the history search mechanism.
<p>
By default, all REPLs share a common global environment and this
environment is reset by <tt>clean-environment</tt>.
This means that, by default, any definitions in any REPL are lost 
when you clean the environment.
If you instead enter and evaluate <tt>(clean-environment 'own)</tt>
into a REPL, that REPL will use a clean private environment that is
not affected by cleaning the shared environment of other REPLs.
To make this REPL revert back to the shared environment, simply use
<tt>(clean-environment)</tt>, without the optional <tt>own</tt> argument.
