This directory contains an implementation of a seizure detection based
on eeg signals.  The algorithm was published in "Detecting Seizure
Onset in the Ambulatory Setting: Demonstrating Fe$ibility" by A. Shoeb et
al, 2005.

This directory contains a number of different versions of the algorithm:

  SeizureDetection.cpp: The original implementation, by Eugene Shih

  eeg.ws: The initial WaveScript port
  eeg_static.ws: A version without dynamic memory allocation
  eeg_fixedapprox.ws: A further refinement that replaces floating
    point arithmetic with fixed point.  (Unfinished.)
