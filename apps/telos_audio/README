There are several ways to build this application.  Different
configurations might have the code running entirely on the PC,
entirely on the embedded device (Telos or phone) or split between
them.

A basic compile runs it on the server.  The current prototype just
runs on empty data pushed by a timer, so it doesn't need sensor data
or a trace file.

  wsc2 mfcc6_fixedpoint_fb.ws
  ./query.exe

Also, it runs on the node:

  wstiny mfcc6_fixedpoint_fb.ws
  ./query.py
OR
  make -f Makefile.tos2 install telosb
  
The next step is to compile the application split across the two platforms.

  wstiny -split mfcc6_fixedpoint_fb.ws

Sorting out all these redundant mfcc_*.ws files.

 mfcc1.ws:
   Initial version.  One big iterate, dynamic memory alloc.
     
 mfcc2_static.ws:
   First, I used statically allocated comm buffers instead of sigsegs.

 mfcc3_splitup.ws:
   Next, I split up the iterate into multiple operators.

 mfcc4_fixedpoint.ws:
   Moved the FFT over to fixedpoint.

 mfcc5_fixedpoint_full.ws:
   Added cepstrel coefficient.

 mfcc6_fixedpoint_fb.ws:
   Changed filterbank from floating to fixed.
