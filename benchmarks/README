This directory contains various WaveScript Benchmarks.

Various subdirectories contain different categories of benchmarks.
There are some shared files in this directory that are used by
multiple subdirectories.

Here is an index of the subdirectories:

 alloc/
   Testing allocation/collection.

 appbench/
   Application benchmarks.  Mostly these are scripts to run 
   code that lives in the ../apps/ directory.

 compile_stats/
   These aren't really benchmarks.  Rather they're scripts that run
   the compiler on a set of programs, and take statistics on those
   compilations.  For example, what percentage of allocation sites
   match certain criteria.

 datareps/
   Comparing data representations, e.g. nested arrays and flat arrays.

 language_shootout/
   Benchmarks from the "great language shootout".

 matrix/
   Matrix tests.

 michael/
   A benchmarking infrastructure written by Michael Craig.

 microbench/
   Small benchmarks testing one particular language feature.
