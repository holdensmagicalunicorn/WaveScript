This directory includes ported StreamIT benchmarks.  These are useful
for a few reasons:

 (1) Comparing performance against StreamIT.
 (2) Having more benchmarks is always good.
 (3) Testing the effectivenes of the "streamit.ws" embeddeding of
     StreamIT within WS.

There are two sets of benchmarks, those that use streamit.ws are in
the "pushpop" directory.  And those that represent "natural" WS
translations of the originals are in the "natural" directory.
