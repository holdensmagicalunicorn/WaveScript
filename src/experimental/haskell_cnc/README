README FIRST:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory includes two implementations of CnC for Haskell:
  CncPure.hs -- a purely functional implementation
  Cnc.hs -- an implementation exposing the same interface but using IO internally.

It also contains several example programs written against the CnC for
Haskell API.  You can run these most easily with a little help from
the "run" script, e.g.

 ./run primes.hs 100

Compiles the example program and runs it to count the primes 2-100.


Development notes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2009.08.10] 

I should have been taking some notes earlier on all the ghc compilation issues I was having.  I need to get a 6.11 version built.

But even for 6.10 ... where do I put the -threads option again?

Egad... and now I'm getting this "thread blocked indefinitely" error.

[2009.08.12]

Ok, things are going alright but there's a lot of ground still to cover.
