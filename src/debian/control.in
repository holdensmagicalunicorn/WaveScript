Description:Distributed/parallel stream-processing language & compiler, Chez Scheme hosted
  WaveScript (wavescope.csail.mit.edu) is a functional language for
  writing highly abstract programs that generate efficient dataflow
  graphs through a two-stage evaluation model.  This graph intermediate
  language is executable in several backends (Scheme, ML, Java[ME],
  C/C++, TinyOS) that enable support for various embedded platforms and
  offer different tradeoffs in features, performance, portability,
  compile times, and parallel/distributed execution.  WaveScript is
  primarily used for programming sensor networks, or for parallel
  computation on multicores or clusters.  Includes a C FFI and various
  libraries.
