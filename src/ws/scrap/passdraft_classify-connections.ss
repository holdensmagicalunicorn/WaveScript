;; Ok, there are different ways that one token can spark another.  In
;; a straightforward push relationship one token calls another.  But
;; to enable region formation to operate on a different (and
;; unrelated) timescale from region folding, I allow the region tokens
;; to "activate" the independent pulsation of the fold tokens.

;; region -> fold   : ACTIVATE 
;; region -> map    : ACTIVATE

;; area -> map      : PUSH   
;; area -> fold     : PUSH
