 <IN_PROGRESS>:
================================================================================
Things I'm working on now --Ryan:

 *) Completing static-elaboration for effectful 
 *) Inserting grammars between passes.
 *) Inserting type-checking between passes.
   ~) De-primitive-izing tuple, tupref [2006.10]

 ~~) Moving to generic-traversal for early passes. [2006.10]

 *) Updating type checker to handle partially annotated programs.

 *) Add matrix WS operations

 *) Bringing PLT version back online.
 *) Porting over to common module system.

 *) Fixing let, letrec, lazy-letrec.
    *) Make "let" not desugar... (for consistency with typing rules)
    *) Make letrec strict throughout the compiler.

================================================================================

[2006.09.03]
  Do not desugar one-armed if in the parser!!!

[2006.09.01]
  I have NEVER taken advantage of the "test-this" convention, I should do away with it.

[2006.08.29]

 *) How much work would it be to track source locations?

[2006.08.02]

 *) Encapsulate thread related things into a threads.ss
 *) Is there any way to get "languages" working in PLT?
 *) Finish porting modules to common module format.


[2006.05.02]

 *) Unit tests for deglobalize2


[2006.04.03]

  *) Add type checking to TMs.
  *) Add type checking between all passes of the compiler.
  *) Add more custom grammar checks.
  *) (Maybe fix the system for grammar check errors, it's fundamentally
     broken and a hack.)
  x) Rework type system.
  x) Add and use generic traverse for Regiment as well as TML.
  *) Lift out certain Regiment utilities from individual passes into common files.


================================================================================
FINISHED:

<Done> [2005.10.19] Make the chez version use records.  Better safety that way.
Can't remember why I didn't originally.
<Done> [2006.10] Reorganizing files into a deeper hierarchy. [2006.10.17]
