1) Add type checking to TMs.
2) Add type checking between all passes of the compiler.
3) Add more custom grammar checks.
4) (Maybe fix the system for grammar check errors, it's fundamentally
   broken and a hack.)
5) Rework type system.
6) Add and use generic traverse for Regiment as well as TML.
7) Lift out certain Regiment utilities from individual passes into common files.

<Done> 
Make the chez version use records.  Better safety that way.
Can't remember why I didn't originally.


[2004.05.25]  I'm making a note of things I need to do when I cool this code base down:

Export useful things from helpers.ss to my generic utility files, including:
  default-unit-tester
  display-constrained
