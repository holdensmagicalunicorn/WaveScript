There are many demos in this directory.  You'll notice that there are
several with the same number but different letters.  They're roughly
grouped like this:

 demo1* : Can we read in data? 
 demo2* : Can we iterate over a stream?
 demo3* : Shallow and broad tests of various primitives/datatypes.
 demo4* : Can we do an FFT? (Will test other signal processing here.)
 demo5* : Can we handle sigsegs?
 demo6* : Can we sync streams?
 demo7* : A more substantial program: Marmot phase 1.
 demo8* : Fancy language features, syntactic sugars and generic arith.
