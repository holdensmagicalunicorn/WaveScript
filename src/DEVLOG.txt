I'm writing down most of my *thinking* in AMORIDEAS.emacs.txt.  But I
realized that my day-to-day development issues should go in a separate
file; so here we are. -2004.04.29

  Hmm, without "identifier-syntax" I can't get things working fully
under PLT.  Until I can write a "lazy-letrec" macro for PLT I'm not
going to be able to have testing in drscheme.  Sigh.  Ok, for the
moment I'm just going to focus on the chez code.

WEIRD. Chez scheme started up with the normal heap is hanging on
(define-record a (b c)).  What is wrong with my system right now??

  Right now I'm trying to hack the final Sim_nought together.
Annoying model/view issues without object system.  It's gonna be work
to get the plt version working.

  15:30: There! Dammit, the basic simulator works in swl.  Now gotta
get an actual meaningful display of it up.
