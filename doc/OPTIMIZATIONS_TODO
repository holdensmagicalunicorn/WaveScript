[2006.04.28] Here I'm going to write down a list of optimizations that
we can work on, or at least think about.

Typical rewrite optimizations
-----------------------------
 *) Filter reordering
 *) Fusion of maps/filters/folds
As with databases, you would expect many of these optimizations to be
profile-driven.


Dynamic optimizations
-----------------------------
 *) Region subsumption 
    1) Global: a (khood 3) subsumes a (khood 2) from the same origin.
       If we catch this at the root, still have time to tell the
       outgoing message to fire both region's membership events on its
       way out.
    2) Local: at some particular point a gradient message with a TTL 
       smaller than one that came before it, can be subsumed by the
       earlier message, *provided* that they both flow into the same
       region, control wise.  (For example, they are subregions that
       are being unioned.)
 *) Load balancing via signal rerouting or join-point mobility.  This
    should be accomplished at a low level of abstraction in the
    communication library.
