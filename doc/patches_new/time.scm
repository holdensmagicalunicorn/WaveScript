;;;; This is the date and time library, on which many LAML facilities rely.
;;;; Time is represented as an integer, which represents the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.
;;;; This library contains functions which translate from seconds to year, month, day, hour, and second. 
;;;; Also the reverse translation is provided for. Besides this, the library provides functions for calculating the weekday and
;;;; the week number.
;;;; Weekday and month names can be returned in either Danish og English, depending on the variable language-preference.
;;;; The language-preference binds at a late time, not loadning time.
;;;; Be aware that you need to modify the variable time-zone-info when summer time (daylight saving time) is started and ended.
;;;; .title Reference Manual of the Time Library

; main functions: time-decode, second-count and weekday.
;
; second-count and time-decode are inverse functions. Example:
; (time-decode (second-count 1998 2 17 10 10 40)) = (1998 2 17 10 10 40)

; Given a number of seconds from January 1 in a base year, say 1900,
; calculate year, month, day, hour, minute and second. The result is
; returned as a list (which may not be the most efficient data structure...).
; Does not take leap seconds into account.

; Example (time-decode 1234567890) = (1939 2 14 0 31 30)

; take base-year as second count 0:
(define base-year 1970)

;;; Time zone and Daylight Saving Time correction.

;; Defines the time-zone. We also use this variable to adjust for daylight saving time.
;; This is, however, kind of a hack.
;; How many hours in front relative to Greenwich, England.
;; The US east coast: 5. California 8. Denmark -1
;; If the encoded time is already corrected on your system, time-zone-info must be 0.

;(define time-zone-info -2)  ; DK Summer time: -2.  DK Winter time: -1.
;; RRN:
(define time-zone-info 5)  ; DK Summer time: -2.  DK Winter time: -1.


;;; Basic time functions.
;;; According to the conventions used in LAML, the function current-time is assumed to return the current time,
;;; represented as the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00.
;;; In this section there are functions that encode and decode a number of seconds to and from
;;; a conventional time representation (in terms of year, month, day, hour, minutes, second).

;; Given an integer n, which is the number of second since january 1, 1970,
;; return a list:  (year month day minutes seconds).
;; The opposite function is called second-count
(define (time-decode n)
  (let* ((year-seconds (years-and-seconds (encoded-time-zone-correction n)))

         (seconds (fourth days-hours-minutes-seconds))
         (day-month (day-and-month (first days-hours-minutes-seconds) year))
         (day (first day-month))
         (month (second day-month)))
     (list year month day hours minutes seconds)))

;; Given date and time in terms of year y, month mo, day d, hour h, minutes mi, and seconds s, caluculate the second count.
;; The second-count function compensates for time zone.
;; The opposite function is called date-time.
(define (second-count y mo d h mi s)
