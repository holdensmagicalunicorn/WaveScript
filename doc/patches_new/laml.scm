; This file is made during the LAML configuration process - DO NOT EDIT!

;;;; .title Reference Manual of the LAML library
;;;; The file <kbd>laml.scm</kbd> is the very first laml file to load.
;;;; It contains a number of variable and functions which must be defined whenever LAML is used.
;;;; Some of the variables - the configuration variables - are defined via the LAML configuration process.
;;;; It also contains some very fundamental LAML stuff, including a number of top level commands that activate LAML tools.
;;;; Physically, laml.scm is composed of a tiny, configuration dependent file followed by the file laml-fundamental.scm.
;;;; These two files are documented together.<p>
;;;;
;;;; <kbd>laml.scm</kbd> loads 
;;;; the scheme/OS/platform specific compatibility file
;;;; and the <a href="../lib/man/general.html">general library</a> from the <kbd>lib</kbd> directory.
;;;;
;;;; It is assumed that the value of the variable <kbd>laml-dir</kbd> is the full path of the LAML directory;
;;;; <kbd>laml-dir</kbd> must be defined when <kbd>laml.scm</kbd> is loaded, and the path must end in a "/".
;;;; The laml command prompt command and the LAML Emacs activation commands will take care of the definition of <kbd>laml-dir</kbd> for you.


; Physically, this file constitute the configuration dependent part.
; The configuration independent part are located in laml-fundamental.scm

; CONFIGURATION SECTION:

;; The Scheme system on which LAML depends (a symbol).
;; Possible values are: mzscheme, scm, guile, drscheme.
;; The value is frozen by the LAML configuration program.
(define scheme-system 'chez)

;; The platform on which LAML is in use (a symbol).
;; Possible values are: windows, unix, mac. mac is not yet in use.
;; The value is frozen by the LAML configuration program.
(define laml-platform 'unix)

;; The operating system on which LAML is in use (a symbol).
;; Possible values on the windows platform: win98, win95, nt40, win2000.
;; Possible values on the unix platform: solaris-6, solaris-7, or linux.
;; The value is frozen by the LAML configuration program.
(define operating-system 'linux)

;; The scheme library relative to laml-dir. A string.
;; A single directory name (without ending slash).
;; The value is frozen by the LAML configuration program.
;; You can change this if you use an alternative or experimental LAML library.
(define laml-library "lib")

;; A variable that refers to the version of LAML, bound at LAML installation time.
;; .returns A string that contains the version number and a short description.

; Determines how the laml processing is initiated. A symbol.
; rich: Information is transferred from the context such that the Scheme system knows the 
; file name and the start-up directory.
; poor: No information is transferred from the context.
; We now always use the value rich - in reality this variable does not play a role any longer.
(define laml-activation 'rich)


; The default name of an LAML output file.
; In case laml-activation is 'rich we use the name of the laml file to determine the name of the html output file.
; In poor laml activation situations we use the value of the variable laml-default-output-file.
; A file name without initial path and without extension.
; This variable does not play a role any longer.
(define laml-default-output-file "default")

; The default directory of LAML output.
; In case laml-activation is 'rich we use the name of the startup directory 
; (as returned by (startup-directory scheme-system) to determine this directory.
; The variable laml-default-output-directory is only used in case of poor laml-activation.
; This variable does not play a role any longer.
(define laml-default-output-directory "")

; The machine on which I use LAML-based software.
; This variable is not used any place in the LAML software, so *you* can forget about.
; I use it in the setup files of the LENO and course-plan systems. The variable allows
; me to find out on which machine I am running. Files, on which I rely, may be placed different
; places on different machines.
; Possible values: cs-unix, home-pc, thinkpad

;; The function begin-laml is supposed to be called at the time all LAML software loading is done.
;; The function is also available via the alias end-laml-loading.
;; The function loads the LAML init file, typically called .laml.
;; By loading the LAML init file when all software is loaded, it is always possible to redefine crucial parts in the LAML init file. 
;; In HTML, SVG and similar contexts it is the responsibility of the document author to call begin-laml (as well as end-laml).
;; In contexts where we process a more elaborate XML-in-LAML document, the software that processes the document calls begin-laml.
